# Filling-Curve Calculator

This tool calculates the filling curve for vertical and horizontal tanks with semi-elliptic heads.

A simple numerical integration method is used for the calculations.

- The vertical tank is approximated as a solid of revolution for volume calculation.

- The volume of the horizontal tank is computed incrementally by integrating cross-sectional areas along the tankâ€™s horizontal axis.
